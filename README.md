## DINO Training  

For DINO training, we adapted the codebase from [DINO4Cells](https://github.com/broadinstitute/DINO4Cells_code). Please refer to their repository for detailed instructions. The checkpoints to our model can found in [add FigShare].

## CellViewer  

To obtain representative cell images shown in Fig. 3, Suppl. Fig. S5â€“S7, S9, S10, and S14, we used the **CellViewer** tool. The code for CellViewer is available at [Add CellViewer GitHub Link].
