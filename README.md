# SINGLE-CELL MORPHOLOGICAL PROFILING REVEALS
INSIGHTS INTO CELL DEATH 
This repository contains analysis scripts for the paper Single-cell morphological profiling reveals insights into cell death (add link)

The analysis scripts include model trainings, calculation of key metrics as well as code to generate the figures in the paper.
The scripts are split into unsupervised and supervised analysis. 


## DINO training

For DINO training, we refer to https://github.com/broadinstitute/DINO4Cells_code, from which we adapted the code-base.

## CellViewer

To obtain the representative images shown in Fig. 3, Suppl. Fig S5-S7, S9, S10 and S14 we refer to (ADD Cellviewer github).
